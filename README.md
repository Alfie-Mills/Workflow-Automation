# Workflow Automation
Collection of scripts to manage web development workflows

## Getting started
To use this repo you'll need some prerequisites, feel free to skip any you don't need

### 1. Install pyenv

This will install pyenv which you can use to manage python versions
```zsh
brew install pyenv
```

This will give you some text that you will need to add to the bottom of you `~/.zshrc` file before continuing and then restart your shell. 
```zsh
pyenv init
```

### 2. Install Poetry

We're going to need python so, lets do that
```zsh
pyenv install 3.10
```
We are using python 3.10 in this project so lets download that. 

Now we need to tell pyenv we want to use that verision. You can wither set this globally, or just for this directory.

*Global:*
```zsh
pyenv global 3.10
```
*Local:*
```zsh
pyenv local 3.10
```

Install the poetry library
```zsh
pip3 install poetry
```

Finally, run the command
```zsh
poetry run wfa --help
```
